        <p>Hi, my name is Sebastian, a student at MKA with a passion for Computer Science.
            <br><br>
            I have enjoyed programming since I started coding in Java in 7th grade. This has led me to solve computer science problems online and create my own projects.<br><br>

            Outside computer science, I love to play soccer, and support Manchester United in the Premier League.
            I also enjoy video games, with <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> currently being my favorite. When it comes to books, <i>Neuromancer</i> by William Gibson holds the top spot for me, with <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> by Philip K. Dick as a close second.
            I also like philosophy and pondering the age-old debate of human nature versus nurture.

            <br><br>I live with my parents and twin sister in New Jersey, and enjoy running around with my dog, Neo.

            <br><br>My next big Computer Science projects include an algorithmic trading model that analyzes market data to make decisions and a natural language processing tool that uses rhetorical
            analysis to identify bias on Social Media platforms and in news sources.

    function cycleImages() {
        var aboutImage = document.getElementById("about-image");

        // Change the image source
        aboutImage.src = imageSources[currentImageIndex];

        // Increment the image index (loop back to the first image if at the end)
        currentImageIndex = (currentImageIndex + 1) % imageSources.length;
    }

    // Call cycleImages function on page load (optional)

    // Set an interval to change images every 5 seconds (adjust as needed)
    setInterval(cycleImages, 2000);
